\title{Sprint Review Meeting}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

The sprint review meeting was conducted on the 11th of August. The four items on the sprint planning meeting were: \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Register User
\item Login
\item View Upcoming Events
\item Post an Event
\end{itemize}

The first three were demonstrated and they proved to be working fine. The last item was declared as unfinished and moved to spring review meeting two.

Someone from the scrum development team suggested the use of a strong password. This was then added to the Product Backlog. The use of searching for an event and being able to remove an event was also suggested. This was also added to the Product Backlog.
